# LSNC Google API Project #

The LSNC Google API Project is a national demonstration project funded by the LSC [Technology Initiative Grants Program](http://tig.lsc.gov/). This project is maintained by [Legal Services of Northern California](http://www.lsnc.net/) (LSNC), a ten-office legal aid program serving low-income clients in 23 counties in the upper third of California.

The project will demonstrate how open source Google APIs can be used for practical integration of the Google Apps platform with open source case management systems used by legal service programs. The practical goal of the project is to overcome the lack of integration between LSNC's domain-specific Google Apps platform and the [Pika CMS](http://pikasoftware.com/), an open source PHP-based application. Specific objectives of the project include creation of practical solutions for integrating select content elements of Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Docs and Google Groups into Pika.

LSNC's development partner on this project is [MC+A](http://www.mcplusa.com/), headquartered in Chicago. Since 2002, MC+A has provided integration solutions for managing business intelligence and assisting clients to find, manage and share information more efficiently. MC+A was one of the first [Google Enterprise Partners](http://www.google.com/enterprise/marketplace/viewVendorListings?vendorId=66) and is also on the Board of Advisors to [Open Pipeline](http://www.openpipeline.org/).
